# Ideas for .NET Language (temporary name: "Fresh")

## The aims of the language

> I want to do to C# what Kotlin did to Java

It should be a high-level language which could replace C#. Here are a few major key points that we aren't changing:

- It is strongly statically typed
- It is not academic & should be easily used by a regular .NET developer
- It should be more or less readable by people not knowing it (as opposed to ML, for instance)
- It should be debuggable
- It prefers generalized approaches over sugared special cases

## Propose your ideas!

Now that you grasped the main idea, feel free to open an issue which

- Proposes a language idea. No strict requirements, so for now, any idea is welcomed
- Tells about your experience using any programming language. Tell us what you find interesting about a language or what you disliked about it
