## The aims of the language

> I want to do to C# what Kotlin did to Java

It should be a high-level language which could replace C#. Here are a few major key points that we aren't changing:

- It is strongly statically typed
- It is not academic & should be easily used by a regular .NET developer
- It should be more or less readable by people not knowing it (as opposed to ML, for instance)
- It should be debuggable
- It prefers generalized approaches over sugared special cases
- It adds a bigger and more worked out feature earlier, than an underspecified one that will result in extra features to work out the missed use cases

## Current state of the project

Right now we are still working out the core of the language. We do this by collecting ideas, inspiration, frustrating things and useful bits from existing languages. Once we have a stable enough core, we can start to formally specify the language. Until then, we have a [prototype compiler project](https://github.com/LanguageDev/Fresh) that we develop to have the skeleton and infrastructure ready, when the time comes to implement the language.

## Propose your ideas!

Now that you grasped the main idea, feel free to open an issue which

- Proposes a language idea. No strict requirements, so for now, any idea is welcomed
- Tells about your experience using any programming language. Tell us what you find interesting about a language or what you disliked about it
